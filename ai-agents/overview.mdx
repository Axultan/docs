## What are AI Agents?

**AI Agents** are autonomous units designed to perform tasks, make decisions,
and communicate with other AI Agents. Think of it as a team member with
specific skills and roles that contribute to the overall goals of your
organization. You can conceptualize them as your **virtual employees**.

## Key Agent Components

### Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base serves as the central repository for an AI Agent's information, including files, links, memories, and integrations. It enables agents to access and utilize relevant data for informed decision-making and task execution.
