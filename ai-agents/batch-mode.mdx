## Overview

Spreadsheet Mode in our AI Agents platform offers a powerful way to automate tasks across multiple rows of a spreadsheet. This feature allows you to run an agent on every row, using the data from each row to trigger the agent and perform the desired actions or generate responses.

## How It Works

When Spreadsheet Mode is initiated, each row in the spreadsheet is processed sequentially. The data from each row is used as input for the agent, which then performs its assigned task based on the information provided.

### Use Cases

- **Mass Text Generation**: Generate personalized text outputs for each row of data.
- **Task Automation**: Automate tasks such as importing deals into CRM systems, analyzing data, and sending mass emails.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Save time by automating repetitive tasks across large datasets.
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniformity and accuracy by leveraging AI for mass operations.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale operations without manual intervention.

## Conclusion

Spreadsheet Mode enhances your ability to manage large volumes of data by leveraging AI agents for automated processing. Whether it's generating text or automating tasks, this feature maximizes efficiency and productivity.
