## Introduction to Triggers

Triggers in our AI Agents platform allow agents to initiate actions automatically based on specific events or conditions. This automation enhances efficiency by enabling agents to respond to certain stimuli without manual input from users.

## Available Triggers

Currently, we support the following trigger:

- **Gmail Email Received**: When an email is received in Gmail, it can trigger a predefined response or action by the AI agent.

## Future Expansion

We plan to expand our catalogue of triggers to include more options, providing greater automation capabilities and flexibility for our users.

## Conclusion

Triggers are a powerful feature that can significantly streamline workflows and improve responsiveness in your operations. By automating responses based on specific events, your AI agents can handle tasks more efficiently and with minimal manual intervention.
