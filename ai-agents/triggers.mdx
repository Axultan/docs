## Introduction to Triggers

Triggers in our AI Agents platform enable agents to initiate actions automatically based on specific events or conditions. This automation improves efficiency by allowing agents to respond without manual input.

### Supported Triggers

1. **Scheduler Trigger**: Automatically initiates actions at specified times or intervals.
2. **Webhook Trigger**: Responds to events from external systems via webhooks.
3. **Email Triggers**: Activates based on incoming emails.
4. **CRM Triggers (Inbox messages)**: Initiates actions when new messages are received in the CRM inbox.

## Conclusion

Triggers streamline workflows and improve operational responsiveness. By automating responses based on specific events, AI agents handle tasks more efficiently with minimal manual intervention.
