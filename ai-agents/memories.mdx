Memories in our AI Agents platform serve as an extension of the Knowledge Base. When you save a "Memory," it is stored in the Knowledge Base and can be retrieved by the agents just like other files and data. This capability allows agents to remember and utilize past interactions for more contextually aware responses.

## How to Save Memories

There are three primary ways to save memories:

1. **Remember a Message**: Hover over a specific message and click "Remember this." This action saves the message pair (both the prompt and AI response) to the Knowledge Base, making it immediately available to the agent you're interacting with.
   
2. **Remember a Thread**: Click on the menu button of any conversation thread and select "Remember thread." This will save all messages from that thread to the Knowledge Base, enabling them for the agent's use.

3. **Auto-Memory Creation** *(Coming soon)*: Enable the "Auto-memory creation" tool. This allows the agent to automatically detect and save information deemed important during interactions, adding it to the Knowledge Base without manual intervention.

## Sharing Memories Across Agents

Memories are versatile and not limited to individual agents. You can enable memories saved by one agent for use by another, facilitating shared knowledge and improving collaborative efficiency among multiple agents.

## Conclusion

Memories enhance the functionality of AI agents by allowing them to recall previous interactions and context, ensuring more informed and relevant responses. By integrating memories seamlessly into the Knowledge Base, your AI agents become smarter and more effective with each interaction.
