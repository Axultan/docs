## Overview

The system message is the hidden instruction telling the AI Agents how to behave.

It allows you to modify the personality traits of the AI Agent, giving you the ability to provide specific instructions about how it should interact throughout the conversation. This could be making your agent more formal or informal, technical or user-friendly, serious or humorous, based on the needs of your business or individual use case. 

## Using Uploaded Documents 
When documents are uploaded into the knowledge base and selected for the AI Agent to use, the retrieved context will automatically appear at the end of the system message in the following format.
