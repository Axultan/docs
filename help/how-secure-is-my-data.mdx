title: "How Secure is My Data?"
---

We take data security seriously and have built our platform with this in mind. Here's how we protect your information:

## End-to-End Encryption

User data is encrypted from the moment it leaves your device until it reaches our servers. This ensures that your data is protected while in transit and at rest.

## Secure File Storage

Uploaded files are securely stored in encrypted S3 buckets. This provides an additional layer of security for any sensitive files you may upload to our platform.

## Zero Data Retention

We have "zero data retention" agreements with our model providers, such as Open AI. This means that your data is not stored or used for training purposes. As soon as your data is processed, it is deleted from our servers.

At our company, we are committed to protecting your data and ensuring your privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our data security practices, please don't hesitate to contact us.
